      <p class="bio-intro">
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelcastroe/" title="See full profile"><strong>Miguel Castro</strong></a> is a Creative & Research Director who creates tools to see what usually remains unseen. His work turns technology into a method of revelation — exposing hidden systems, silent behaviors, and overlooked truths. With a background in AI and narrative systems, he transforms code into empathy, and platforms into quiet witnesses. Behind the Fear reflects his ongoing pursuit to make the invisible not just visible, but undeniable.

      <h2>1. Idea as Territory</h2>
      <p>Domestic violence remains largely invisible — not because it isn’t happening, but because it’s hidden in plain sight. In Peru, 4 out of 10 women experience abuse, yet only 40% seek help, held back by fear, stigma, or lack of trust in institutions.</p>
      <p>This idea begins by acknowledging that silence itself is a territory. That the behaviors victims use to hide distress — like coded gestures or subtle remarks — can be translated into digital patterns. The email becomes a new canvas, not for promotion, but protection. A place where distress can safely hide in sight.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>2. Idea as Organism</h2>
      <p>The concept mimics how victims already navigate their world: embedding meaning where it can’t be overheard. We turned HTML into a silent witness — transforming &lt;meta&gt; tags, hover states, and title attributes into spaces for distress.</p>
      <p>Each email carries a story, not on the surface but behind it. By interacting — hovering, pausing — recipients could decode hidden cries for help. Technology didn’t speak for victims; it listened on their terms. The system didn’t announce. It whispered.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>3. Idea as Culture</h2>
      <p>This wasn’t a campaign. It was a cultural blueprint for using what already exists — email — as a tool of trust. The stories were not fictional. They were real voices of women, preserved inside invisible structures.</p>
      <p>By exposing what’s beneath the code, the project invited a new kind of allyship: tech as a translator of pain. It showed that even routine platforms can be hijacked for dignity. That care can be coded. And that silence, when translated well, can be louder than words.</p>

      <h2>Glossary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meta Tags</strong> — Hidden pieces of HTML used to describe page content, repurposed here to carry emotional data.</li>
        <li><strong>Hover Interaction</strong> — A digital gesture where content reveals itself only when hovered over by the mouse.</li>
        <li><strong>Encoded Disclosure</strong> — Sharing distress through non-obvious, often technical, behaviors or signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Quiet Interface</strong> — A digital design that communicates powerfully through minimal or hidden cues.</li>
        <li><strong>Survivor Pattern Mapping</strong> — Using lived behaviors of survivors to guide the structure of technology.</li>
