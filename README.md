# Behind the Fear | Miguel Castro

**Behind the Fear** is a case study exploring how technology can expose hidden signals of domestic violence using HTML email structures. Instead of traditional campaigns, it encodes real stories within invisible elements like meta-tags and hover interactions.

Directed by **Miguel Castro**, the project reflects a philosophy of designing for the unseen — using creative technology as a means of empathy, exposure, and quiet intervention.
